![Customer Churn](https://www.neenopal.com/images/Understanding%20Customer%20Churn.png)

Welcome to my **Customer Churn Prediction using ANN** repository! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). It is intended to demonstrate the application of deep learning techniques in a practical business scenario.

## ðŸ“š About This Repository

This repository includes the complete workflow for building a churn prediction model. From data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, it covers the entire pipeline needed to predict customer churn effectively.

## âœ¨ What's Inside

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handling missing values by using appropriate imputation techniques.
  - Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
  - Feature scaling to standardize the range of independent variables or features.

- **Model Architecture**: 
  - Implementing a deep neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.
  - The architecture consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation, and an output layer with a sigmoid activation function.
  - Utilized dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

- **Training and Evaluation**: 
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Trained the model using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.
  - Evaluated the model on the test set to check for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Results and Analysis**: 
  - Visualizations to interpret model performance and feature importance.
  - Analysis of model metrics to understand the performance and areas for improvement.
